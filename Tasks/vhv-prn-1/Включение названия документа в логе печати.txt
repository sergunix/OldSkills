I have configured a Server 2012 R2 standard as print server to manage printers and Monitor the print usage of users, however I am not getting the Print logs (Event Log ID 307) in the default event logs directory on the print Server.
I perform some search and come to know that it’s a known problem in Server 2012 and there is Hotfix available. I installed the Hotfix mentioned here http://support2.microsoft.com/kb/2938013/en-us , but still logs are not getting generated.
I also made the below setting for the logs.

1.	Creating Registry entry
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Printers] "ShowJobTitleInEventLogs"=dword:00000001
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Printers] "ShowJobTitleInEventLogs"=dword:00000001

1.	The policy name: Computer Configuration \ Administrative Templates \ Printers Allow job name in event logs

2.	Keep printed Docs setting is also enabled on all the printers installed on Print Server.
Noting seems to be working here or am i doing something wrong here.
